Danger Log for Final Project

04/10

We find that it's much simpler to handle socket programming in
Python. So, we decide to learn by ourselves how to use Python
to do socket programming.

04/11

We find that when we send a message to world, the world will
always return an error message. After some check, we find that
the format of the google protocal buffer we send to world is
not appropriate. Then we edit our format and the bug is fixed.

04/12

We find that if we send a message to Amazon, they cannot parse
it properly. This is because that we add a length info before
the message, but Amazon doesn't parse this length info.

04/13

We find that if we define a global variable, then every time we
change this variable in a function, it will arise an error.
This is because that in Python if we want to use a global variable
in a function, we have to redeclare it as global before we change
it. Otherwise it will be seen as a local variable.

04/14

We find that we need use different threads to handle different
messages from world and Amazon. So, we edit our code to spawn a
new thread to handle every message from world and Amazon. And
every thread tries to resend the same message with the same
sequence number if it doesn't acknowledge number back. The time
period of resending is set to 5 seconds.

04/15

We find that when we receive several pickup requests from Amazon,
we will send the same truck to pickup these different packages.
After careful consideration, we find that this is because there
is data races between threads when they try to query the database
for the same idle trucks. We solve this by change "select" to
"select for update" when we query the database for a truck.

04/16

We find that sometimes the database operation will raise some
error. This is because we always assume that there will be an
avaiable truck to use. But it can be that all the trucks is busy.
We solve this by using a while loop to repeatedly query the database
to see if there is an avaiable truck.
